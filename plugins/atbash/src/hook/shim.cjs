// The shipped entry point. Plain CommonJS, no dependencies, never bundled: it must keep working when
// the bundled hook next to it cannot load. Claude Code lets a tool call proceed when a hook times
// out or exits with a code other than 0 or 2, so the two failures that would silently remove the
// gate are handled here, before the real hook is even loaded:
//   1. a hard deadline under the host's hook timeout (hooks.json: 35 s) - the SDK's per-request
//      budget is up to 30 s and one judgment is two to five requests, so without this a slow but
//      alive judge outlives the host timeout and the host proceeds;
//   2. any failure of the bundled hook itself - a load error, an uncaught exception, an unhandled
//      rejection - becomes a deny with exit 0 instead of exit 1 with nothing on stdout.
// The deny text is fixed here; nothing from the failure is echoed to the host. The deny is written
// synchronously, so it cannot be lost to an undrained pipe; if stdout cannot be written at all the
// shim exits 2 (a blocking error for the host) rather than 0 with an empty, permit-shaped stdout.
// What this cannot close: a synchronous hang inside the bundle or the native addon keeps the event
// loop from ever running the deadline timer; only the host timeout ends that.
